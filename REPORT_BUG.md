# How to report a bug

*Tickets, which can be bug reports or feature requests, are at the origin of any software improvement. As a consequence, the lack of tickets or badly written tickets are serious impairments to a healthy software development. This is pretty similar like building a house on weak foundations, this should be avoided.*

The ticket you are going to write will be handled by an IT expert who might not have that much clue about your context. For this reason, it's really important to be accurate in the way you describe your problem. The more information you can provide about a problem, the better. To be understandable by anybody, tickets must be in English.

### Checks to do before creating a ticket

Before creating a ticket, a few checks need to be done:
+ How many different problems do you concretely face? You should open only one ticket per problem. If you have *N* different atomic problems, then open *N* different tickets.
+ Has this problem already been reported?
+ Do you test against the last (dev) version of the software? If not, and if possible, run your test again with the most recent versoin available. Maybe your problem is already fixed.

### Mandatory

Each ticket must answer clearly to the following questions:
+ What is your environment (browser, version of the software you use, which product, etc.)?
+ What is the detailed step-by-step procedure to reproduce the problem?
+ What do you obtain? A copy of the error message or a screenshot is always useful.
+ What should be the behaviour from your point of view? How do you expect the service to work?

In any case, and at this point of the ticket redaction, adopt the point-of-view of the (final) user: don't try to explain or analyze the problem (this is the job of IT people).

### Optional

To complete your ticket, check if you can deliver more information:
+ What is the context of this ticket? If not obvious, explain why you need to do this.
+ If you have an idea about the technical background of the ticket, please share it also at the end.

### Post ticket creation

A developer will handle your ticket and might have additional questions or feedback to share with you. You will also probably be interested to be informed at the time the ticket is implemented. Secure the way you will be kept informed about it (and try to answer quickly to developer's requests):
+ Configuration of email notifications
+ Create a view on the ticketing tool to follow "your" tickets.

For a better ticket lifecycle, avoid using third party tools to communicate with the developers. Put all your concerns, precisions, etc. as new comments to the ticket.
